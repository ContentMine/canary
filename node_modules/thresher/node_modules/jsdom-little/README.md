[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dorny/jsdom-little.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dorny/jsdom-little)

**WARNING:** this fork is based on legacy jsdom version ~0.10.5.


**UPDATE:** jsdom 4+ doesn't depend on contextify anymore however it no longer works with Node.jsâ„¢ and instead requires [io.js](http://iojs.org).


# jsdom-little
Lightweight cut down version of [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).

## Removed dependencies:
* **contextify**
* xmlhttprequest
* request

## Removed features:
* Running JavaScript code in browser context
* Fetching or processing external resources
* Window
* Events
* XmlHttpRequest
* Content of `<style>` nodes is not evaluated
* jsdom.env works only as ```jsdom.env(html, level, callback)``` and returns ```{document: document}```

## What it is good for?
* You need something from jsdom (DOM, parsing, etc.) but full browser emulation is overkill.
