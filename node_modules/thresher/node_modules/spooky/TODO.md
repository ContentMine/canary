At present, bootstrap.js startup is insane. Fix that:
- [X] emit an error and crash if we receive invalid JSON
- [ ] emit an error and crash if we receive invalid JSON-RPC
- [ ] emit debug logging at interesting moments

Simplify lib/spooky
- [ ] move transports to own modules
- [ ] write error tests, ensure spooky fails gracefully/quickly
